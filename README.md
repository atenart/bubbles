# Bubbles

_Bubbles_ is an open source [GPLv3](https://github.com/atenart/bubbles/blob/master/LICENSE)
tool helping in making beer recipes and (home)brews, by computing various
parameters (color, bitterness, alcohol by volume, gravities, etcâ€¦).

_Bubbles_ starts a web server and listen by default on (http://localhost:8000).
This can be configured thanks to the command line `-bind` option.
